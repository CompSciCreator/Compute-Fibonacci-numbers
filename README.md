# Fibonacci Series Generator

This is a simple Java program that generates a Fibonacci series of a specified length. The program takes user input for the length of the series and then computes and displays the series.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Java Program:**
   You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. To compile the program, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `Fibonacci.java` file is located. Then, compile the code using the following command:

   ```
   javac Fibonacci.java
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   After compiling successfully, run the program using the following command:

   ```
   java Fibonacci
   ```

3. **Input Length of Fibonacci Series:**
   When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the desired length of the Fibonacci series. Enter a positive integer and press Enter.

4. **View Fibonacci Series:**
   The program will then calculate and display the Fibonacci series of the specified length.

5. **Example Output:**
   ```
   Enter the length of Fibonacci series:
   10
   Fibonacci Series:
   0
   1
   1
   2
   3
   5
   8
   13
   21
   34
   ```

6. **Close the Program:**
   Once you've viewed the Fibonacci series, the program will automatically close.

## How It Works

- The program uses an array to store the Fibonacci series.
- It initializes the first two elements of the array (0 and 1).
- It then calculates the subsequent Fibonacci numbers by adding the last two numbers in the series.
- The program prints out the generated Fibonacci series.
